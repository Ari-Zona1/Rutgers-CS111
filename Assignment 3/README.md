# Assignment 3

This repository contains several Java programs that I have written.

## List of Programs

1. CheckDigit.java: a program that calculates the check digit for a given number
2. LargestOfFive.java: a program that determines the largest of five numbers
3. RandomWalker.java: a program that simulates a random walk and displays the path taken

## How to Run the Programs

To run any of the programs, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to the directory where the Java file is located
3. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command, followed by the file name. For example, to compile `CheckDigit.java`, you would enter `javac CheckDigit.java`
4. Run the program using the `java` command, followed by the class name. For example, to run `CheckDigit.java`, you would enter `java CheckDigit`
