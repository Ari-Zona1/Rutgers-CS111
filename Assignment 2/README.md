# Assignment 2

This repository contains several Java programs that I have written. 

## List of Programs

1. HelloWorld.java: a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
2. OrderCheck.java: a program that checks whether a given order is valid or not
3. WindChill.java: a program that calculates the wind chill temperature based on the current temperature and wind speed

## How to Run the Programs

To run any of the programs, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to the directory where the Java file is located
3. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command, followed by the file name. For example, to compile HelloWorld.java, you would enter `javac HelloWorld.java`
4. Run the program using the `java` command, followed by the class name. For example, to run HelloWorld.java, you would enter `java HelloWorld`
